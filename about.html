    <p>This section provides my personal hobbies and interest that I do or liked in my entire life so far.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Cooking — I like to cook a lot and I am following cookbook instruction of different dish that I think I can do.</li>
        <li>Coding — I like to do the coding, but, with no specific reasons sometimes, I just like to encode and create without any purpose to be exact. Moreover, I've done several basic to mid-level projects of coding and python programs.</li>
        <li>Playing Mobile Games — Here in the Philippines, the mobile games are the majority of gaming platform that is pupular. Therefore, if you as me, I play mobile games like Call of Duty - Mobile (CODM), Mobile Legends (ML), and Plants vs. Zombie 2</li>
        <li>Analyzing several things — One key criteria for me having interest in machine learning was my hobbies of taking things out trying to find a pattern or create my own pattern to solve some things like disassembling car toys and provide some other springs on it to provide more wiggling effect.</li>
